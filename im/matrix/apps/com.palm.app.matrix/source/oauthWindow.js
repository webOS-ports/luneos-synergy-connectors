/*
 * OAuthWindow — hosts an OAuth2 sign-in page on builds that have no NPAPI browser plugin.
 *
 * Legacy webOS renders the sign-in page inline in an Atlas-routed enyo.BasicWebView. LuneOS
 * (WAM/Chromium) has no NPAPI at all, so that control can never paint there — and an <iframe>
 * is not a substitute either: Google answers the authorize URL with X-Frame-Options: DENY, and
 * Microsoft's login page frame-busts, navigating the host app's own window away. What LuneOS
 * does have is window.open(), which builds a real top-level WAM window that neither restriction
 * applies to.
 *
 * Capturing the redirect needs these mechanisms, because providers split into two kinds:
 *
 *   http/https redirect_uri (every cloud connector, Tidal)
 *       WAM watches the window for it: window.open() passes the prefix as
 *       attributes={"redirectPrefix": ...}, and WAM reports to this page with a
 *       'webOSOAuthWindow' event, detail {state, url}: "watching" right after the window
 *       opens, then "redirect" (WAM has stopped and closed the window; url is the redirect, code
 *       included) or "closed" (it went without one). WAM matches where navigations start,
 *       commit and fail to load, so a redirect_uri nothing serves (http://localhost/...) is
 *       caught, and it tells this page itself, so the provider's Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy
 *       (Koofr, Tidal), which cuts the window off from this page, does not matter.
 *
 *       A WAM without that watch sends no "watching". Then the window's location is polled.
 *       The renderers do not run with --disable-web-security, so that only works while the
 *       window is same-origin with this page: WAM's own load-error page, which a redirect to an
 *       unserved localhost URL turns into (unwrapLoadError), and nothing else.
 *
 *   native scheme (Teams: msauth.<client>://auth)
 *       The engine cannot load that scheme, so it aborts the navigation and location never
 *       changes — polling alone would wait forever. WAM watches these the same way, catching
 *       the redirect where the load is aborted, and reports it with the same events.
 *
 *       A WAM that watches only http(s) sends no "watching" for these. It still reports the
 *       aborted URL as a 'webOSExternalProtocol' event (NotifyExternalProtocolNavigation), but
 *       only to the window and, from there, to this page — which fails whenever the provider's
 *       login page runs in a renderer of its own, as Microsoft's does: this page is then out of
 *       its reach (SecurityError).
 *
 * Both are armed at once and whichever fires first wins, so a caller does not have to know
 * which kind of redirect its provider uses.
